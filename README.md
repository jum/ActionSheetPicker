## This version is deprecated: use [**ActionSheetPicker-3.0**](https://github.com/skywinder/ActionSheetPicker-3.0) instead.

This repo is **outdated**. You can find new version of ActionSheetPicker (iOS 8 compatible alredy) here: [**ActionSheetPicker-3.0**](https://github.com/skywinder/ActionSheetPicker-3.0).

I try to resolve a lot of pull requests and issues in this repo by time, but new updates will be appeared in https://github.com/skywinder/ActionSheetPicker-3.0. I forked from this repo and implement a bunch of fixes.
